# Krishi-Ganit Optimizer (Kisan-Math) 🌾➕

> **Empowering Farmers with Mathematical Precision.**
> A project submitted for the "Build the Future" Showcase.

## 📖 Overview

**Krishi-Ganit Optimizer** is a web application designed to help farmers maximize their yield and minimize waste. By combining farming knowledge with mathematical logic, this tool allows users to input their land details and resource constraints to get optimized recommendations.

Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**, it bridges the gap between traditional agriculture and modern resource management.

## ✨ Features

- **Smart Input System:** Easy-to-use interface for farmers to input land size and available resources.
- **Auto-Conversions:** Built-in utility to handle various agricultural units (e.g., acres to hectares, kg to quintal).
- **Optimization Logic:** Calculates the best distribution of resources.
- **Instant Results:** Clear, actionable feedback displayed in a modal.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React 18
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Styling:** CSS / Tailwind
